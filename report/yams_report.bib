  abstract = {The following is a list of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response status codes. This includes codes from IETF internet standards as well as other IETF RFCs, other specifications and some additional commonly used codes. The first digit of the status code specifies one of five classes of response; the bare minimum for an HTTP client is that it recognises these five classes. The phrases used are the standard examples, but any human-readable alternative can be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the HTTP/1.1 standard (RFC 7231).
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official registry of HTTP status codes.
Microsoft IIS sometimes uses additional decimal sub-codes to provide more specific information, but these are not listed here.},
